# Companionem Linguae
Companionem Linguae is an ultra large language model in early stages of development.

We will start collecting proto-languages, language families, language branches, languages, etc. soon.

Companionem Linguae is being reworked.
I have uploaded a part of the new training data (Latein.json).
Although English is the standard for international communication, 
I decided to train the model with Latin and German first, 
because these languages have many grammatical features the English language doesn't have, 
but they could be useful for translations into French, Portuguese, Spanish, or other languages that have similar grammatical features.
