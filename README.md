Features (v0.1)
- SQLite database with 2 Latin verbs (discere, amare)
- 36 conjugated forms (imperfect, perfect, future)
- 4 usage examples
- Grammatical metadata (tense, person, number, mood)

## Roadmap
- [ ] Expand vocabulary (100+ Latin words)
- [ ] Add support for nouns, adjectives, adverbs
- [ ] Implement n-gram language detection
- [ ] Add support for: Marubo, other marginalized languages
- [ ] Build simple chat interface (tkinter)
- [ ] Integrate ML-based translation (for high-resource languages)

## Why?
Most NLP tools focus on major languages. This project aims to preserve and make accessible:
- **Dead languages** (Latin, Ancient Greek)
- **Marginalized languages** (Marubo, other indigenous languages)
- **Hybrid approach:** Rule-based for low-resource, ML for high-resource

## Collaboration
Currently working with Claudio Marubo (native speaker) to collect Marubo language data.
